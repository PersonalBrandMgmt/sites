In order to deepen my technical understanding of company finances, I took a financial model bootcamp with Adventis. In the course I learned to build fully circular, three-statement financial models from scratch and practiced the techniques and ideas beyond the bootcamp. I then completed both levels of certifications, showing that I have internalized the modeling techniques as well as concepts of accounting, corporate finance, intrinsic and relative valuation, and leveraged buyout transactions.
Going forward, I am acting as a campus rep to promote their program to business students who donâ€™t know that they can benefit from this.
