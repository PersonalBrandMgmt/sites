I have decided to prepare for the CFA exam in December with the intention of becoming a member of CFA Institute in the long term. I believe the curriculum in my university courses this year and next will lend itself nicely to my success in the first CFA exam. Currently, I am undecided to pursuing a Masters degree and so starting the CFA program is the step Iâ€™m taking at the moment to prepare myself for work following next year.
