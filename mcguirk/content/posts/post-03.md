The Deacon Fund, of all my extracurriculars, has been the most effective channel of keeping me current and engaged in markets and technology. On a daily basis, the group uses slack to have open conversations on interesting articles and business implications of recent news. Longer term projects include preparing stock proposals, pitching stocks to a panel, raising money for the fund, and following equity under coverage.
