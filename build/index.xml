      <description>In order to deepen my technical understanding of company finances, I took a financial model bootcamp with Adventis. In the course I learned to build fully circular, three-statement financial models from scratch and practiced the techniques and ideas beyond the bootcamp. I then completed both levels of certifications, showing that I have internalized the modeling techniques as well as concepts of accounting, corporate finance, intrinsic and relative valuation, and leveraged buyout transactions.</description>

      <description>The Deacon Fund, of all my extracurriculars, has been the most effective channel of keeping me current and engaged in markets and technology. On a daily basis, the group uses slack to have open conversations on interesting articles and business implications of recent news. Longer term projects include preparing stock proposals, pitching stocks to a panel, raising money for the fund, and following equity under coverage.</description>

      <description>I have decided to prepare for the CFA exam in December with the intention of becoming a member of CFA Institute in the long term. I believe the curriculum in my university courses this year and next will lend itself nicely to my success in the first CFA exam. Currently, I am undecided to pursuing a Masters degree and so starting the CFA program is the step Iâ€™m taking at the moment to prepare myself for work following next year.</description>
